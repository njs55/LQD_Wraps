1520 Project

What has changed from Part 1:
1. Added content to the 3 shopping pages to give an idea of what the page would look like for a customer.
	- Each image has some nice CSS on it that utilizes a psuedo class ".shop-column:hover", which shows the user what they are 
	  hovering over.
	- jQuerey is also used, I used the LightBox library. It allows you to click on the image and then	the image enlarges. 
	  You can then scroll through all the images if you chose to.

2. Added Form Validation to the request a quote form
	-Uses jQuery in the lqdwraps.js file that I wrote to check certain fields that I felt were required	before 
	 allowing the form to be submitted. If something is left blank the user is notified with red text.

3. Images were organized in more detail in the folders because there are so many now.

4. The Pricing, Warranty, and Wrap Care pages were adjusted with CSS just to make them look nicer and 
   fix some spacing that was bothering me on the pages.
   
5. The data entered into the form is now sanitized to prevent SQL Injection.
  - How I went about this was by actually not using MySQL. I instead used PDO to send the data to the database.
  - This can be found in the 'sendQuote.php'.

If there was a third part what would I change:
1. I'd like to add a way for a customer to add an image to the form in case they wanted to show us what color they wanted.
  -I didn't do this because it just wasnt required by the project and I was running out of time.
  
2. The site needs to have Ecommerce added to it and a way to create a shopping cart for customers to buy the products from the shop pages.
  - Would need to figure out what all needs to be done for that to be achieved. I'm hoping there are Ecommerce plugins I could download.
  
3. I would also add descriptions for the products that are shown under shop. Come up with neat way to show it as well.

4. I might want to edit the code with some guidelines. Like maybe a character limit per line.

What have I learned:
  I learned a great deal from this project. When I started I had zero experience with web development. Now I feel that I have
  a decent understanding. The site looks nice and does what it needs to do. I was starting to get really good with CSS towards the end,
  versuses the beginning I was pretty clueless how to use CSS. I have a firm grasp on how everything should be laid out.
  I'm pretty comfortable with jQuery. I am not a fan of SQL, I really liked reading and learning about PHP Data Object (POD), 
  which I used to sanitize and write to my database. Also learned a little about databases. I will be taking a databases class next semester.
  
What did I like about the project and how could it be better:
  I really liked how we could pretty much do whatever we wanted. It gave me an opportunity to work on my companies website. 
  This in turn also motivated me to do a great job on the website. I thought the project was a great way to learn for beginners like myself.
  The best way to learn is to do and this certainly made me do that. 
  As for what I would change, I would maybe make a couple more neceassry requirements, like having to Read AND write from a database.
  Or maybe use a psuedo:class somewhere as a requirment. Other than that I thought the project was nice and laid back, but I
  was still learning a lot which is good.
